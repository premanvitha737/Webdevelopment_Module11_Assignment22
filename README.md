IELTS Speaking Test Web App - Assignment 22
Project Overview
The IELTS Speaking Test Web App is designed to simulate the speaking test section of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). This web application provides users with dynamically generated speaking questions using artificial intelligence, helping them practice for the speaking test. The app uses a React frontend for a responsive user experience and a Flask backend to manage real-time question generation, logging, and API communication.

This application allows users to choose the difficulty level and question type, take the speaking test, track their progress, and receive dynamic questions generated by Gemini AI. The frontend also integrates features like a countdown timer to manage time during each section of the test and a reusable modal component to display test instructions and results.

Key Features
Dynamic Question Generation: The app generates IELTS speaking test questions in real time using Gemini AI. Users can select the difficulty and question type, such as "part 1" or "part 2" questions, based on their practice needs.

Timed Test Sections: Each test section is equipped with a countdown timer, allowing users to simulate real test conditions. The timer is integrated with the question progression to maintain a structured test flow.

Reusable Modal Component: The modal is used to display test instructions and results. It ensures a seamless user experience, providing users with relevant information and feedback in a dynamic, accessible format.

User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and track their progress throughout their practice sessions. This feature allows them to save their test attempts and monitor improvement over time.

Backend API: The Flask-based backend handles AI question generation requests, manages user data, and handles interactions with the frontend through well-defined API endpoints.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Axios for API integration, react-timer-hook for the countdown timer, Bootstrap for responsive styling.

Backend: Flask for the backend framework, Gemini AI for real-time question generation, Python logging for structured event tracking.

How It Works
User Interaction: Users interact with the frontend, selecting their preferred question type and difficulty level.

AI Integration: The backend generates dynamic questions using the Gemini AI model based on the input parameters.

Test Flow: Users proceed through different sections of the speaking test, with the timer counting down for each section.

Progress Tracking: Once the test is completed, users can view their results in a modal and track their performance.

Conclusion
This web app provides a highly interactive, user-friendly platform for users to practice IELTS speaking tests. With real-time AI-generated questions, a countdown timer, and user progress tracking, it simulates real exam conditions and helps users improve their speaking skills for the IELTS exam.
